This library allows RobotFramework to test DHCP clients, by communicating with a DHCP server installed on the test platform and to handle lease events using RobotFramework keywords
Currently, only dnsmasq is supported as DHCP server, and it must be installed separately from this library
RobotFramework will then be able to be notified when leases are added, updated and deleted from dnsmasq
